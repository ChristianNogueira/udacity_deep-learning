## Dependencies

Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.
It was updated to remove some vulnerabilities from old packages

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

### Conda Environments

You can find Conda environment files for the Deep Learning program in the `environments` folder. 
Note that environment files are platform dependent. Versions with `tensorflow-gpu` are labeled in the filename with "GPU".
